PENDING: this chapter will outline the technical design of the Maccabee package which implements the procedural design from Chapter 5. For now, I have included a data generation demonstration notebook (originally submitted with my individual deliverable) which shows the DGP sampling process and verifies that the user specified parameters have the desired effect on the distributional setting of the sampled data.

Some things to consider including

- Aggregation in the benchmarking section
- Abstract Syntax Trees for equation construction
- Parallelism
- Good OOP practices throughout.
