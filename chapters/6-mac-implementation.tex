The implementation of the Maccabee package is described in the \RTDlink{package documentation}. A detailed explanation of the implementation of the sampling procedure outlined in Chapter \ref{chap:macdesign} is located on the \href{\RTDurl/design.html}{design page} of this documentation.

The documentation is also included in this document as Appendix \ref{app:package-docs}. Accessibility is worse in the PDF format given the absence of pagination and cross-linking, so the online documentation is recommended.
